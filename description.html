			<h5>Special Agent Forensic Scientitst</h5>
			<h6>TBI</h6>
			<p>" The TBI's forensic division has 3 laboratories, Nashville, Knoxville, Memphis (which will move to Jackson in a few years)
				<br>As far as daily work it depends on which unit you work in:
				<br>The labs are divided up into different groups, each specialized
				<br>-Forensic Chemistry which analyzes suspected drugs
				<br>-Forensic toxicology which analyzes body fluids for suspected drugs, the DUI cases go to this group
				<br>-Intoximeter which maintains the breath-o-lizer instruments statewide in DUI instances with alcohol.
				<br>-Latent Fingerprints which develops finger prints (and occasionally foot prints) for comparison purposes
				<br>-Forensic Biology which analyzes for DNA in body fluids and stains for comparison purposes
				<br>-Firearms which works with weapons, bullets, and ammunition for comparison purposes
				<br>-Microanalysis which works mostly with ‘trace’ evidence, anything which does not fit into the above groups goes here
				<br>   This is where I have worked since 1982.  We do the following:
				    <br>Shoe track/tire track comparison
				    <br>Fracture match
				       <br> Neither of these are chemistry oriented, mostly physical properties and measurements
				   <br> Glass analysis/comparison
				   <br> Paint analysis/comparison
				   <br> Explosive analysis
				   <br> Fiber analysis/comparison
				      <br>These require microscopy and instrumental analysis of chemical composition, Glass does have some physical
				      <br> property work determining direction of force and order of breakage in addition to comparison.
				   <br> Unknown substances, just what it sounds like, we try and figure out what something is
				   <br> Fire Debris analysis which is all chemistry to identify products used in arson casework
				   <br> Gunshot residue analysis which is used to determine if someone fired/handled/was near a gun when it fired.
				     <br> These last two are the largest number of cases which come in.
				<br>The Nashville Lab has all of these units, Knoxville does not have a firearm unit, microanalysis unit or latent fingerprint unit, Memphis does not have a Latent fingerprint unit or microanalysis unit.  I am not sure if the lineup will change when the Jackson lab opens.
			<h5> Day to Day </h5>	 
				<p>The Day to Day work is not what you would see on CSI or other police dramas.  Most of the time we are examining evidence as it relates to the unit you are assigned to work in.  This could range from test firing weapons to compare bullets from a murder to extracting blood for any drugs, mounting glass fragments on a microscope slide to determine refractive index, and so on.  Too dull to be on TV and occasionally slow going. We don’t finish cases in an hour episode. Every single case is reviewed technically by another examiner to make sure all the chemistry, microscopy, etc is right and then administratively reviewed for over all content.  This takes time and is part of the daily job.  When training starts here no one does casework before they complete their training within that unit, the time can be 6 months in some units to 2 years in others.
				My training starting in 1982 was 18 months. For me I started out doing fire debris which means extracting fire debris for chemical analysis looking for things like gasoline, kerosene, and so on.  This is essentially an instrumental chemistry analysis with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.  I then started doing glass work which is a lot of microscope work to measure optical and physical properties and then elemental composition (more instrumental work, Inductively coupled plasma/mass spectroscopy)  to compare known sources to unknown fragments. Following that I started doing Gunshot Residue examinations (scanning electron microscopy) which to this day take up a lot of my time, in fact that’s pretty much all I do.  Along the way I picked up explosive analysis (not as exciting as you might think, microscopy and chemistry) and stopped doing fire debris casework and do the occasional explosive case and chemical analysis.</p>
				<h5> Other Tasks</h5> 
				<p>Mixed in all this I go to court occasionally, averaging about once a month, anywhere in TN and occasionally out of state but that’s rare.  Occasionally, I will go several times in a month and sometimes not at all that month.  In my unit I go the most, in toxicology they all go often as they have quite a volume of cases involving DUIs.  Drug identification goes pretty regularly too.  It is part of the job and training too with a series of mock trials.</p>
				 
				<p>I also worked crime scenes on a team for years, teams are assigned members from several sections and then are on call for a month at a time to be called out, generally in middle TN now a days.  We only go to violent, serious crimes and now police shootings too. That work is documentation and collection of evidence and can last for many hours and occasionally over a day or night or two.  You work till it’s done. Pretty much everyone is on a crime scene team now." </p>

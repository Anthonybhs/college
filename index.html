			<h5>Special Agent Forensic Scientitst</h5>
			<h6>TBI</h6>
			<p>Special Agent-Forensic Scientists must be able to analyze physical evidence such as tablets, powders, and plant material, and identify chemicals in these materials. Forensic Scientists examine biologic evidence like blood, urine, or tissue samples for drugs, gases, or other toxic substances. Some must determine the manufacturer, caliber, or gauge of weapons or ammunition and compare bullets and cartridges with suspected weapons. Physical evidence such as glass, fibers, hair, paint, gunshot residue, shoe prints, or tire impressions are tested and documented. The nature, type, and origin of biologic or physical evidence to characterize blood and other bodily fluids is determined by Forensic Scientists in Serology/DNA.</p> 
			<p>The Latent Print Unit performs chemical tests on evidence to produce visible latent prints to compare with suspect’s or victim’s prints. All must compose technical laboratory reports describing evidence examined, results, and interpretation of results. Forensic Scientists testify in court as expert witnesses and provide expert opinion testimony.</p>

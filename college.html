			<p> Vanderbilt has an excellent chemistry program. As Special Agent Davis expalined the best degrees to get for those interested in forensic science are: Chemistry, Biology, or other physical sciences. I have chosen Vanderbilt based on its location and the program they offer. Also as one of my job plans is to work with the TBI and Vanderbilt is located in Nashville, and is just down the street from the TBI's Nashville headquaters this seemed like a logical and convenient place to go to college with hopes of an internship. A typical Chemistry degree takes four years to get. </p>

			<h5> <a href="https://www.uic.edu" target="blank"> University Illinois Chicago </a></h5>
			<img src=" img/uic.jpg" alt="UIC logo">
			<p> The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) has an excellent chemistry program. UIC is located in Chicago, which would provide numerous oppertunities for an intership in a forensic science position. This university is very modern and is located far from my home which provides a great insentive to go there however I do not know very much about their relationship with the FBI or a organization like it.  </p>
